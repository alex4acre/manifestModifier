# Generate Package Manifest during Installation and after Re-install

## Operation

Install the snap. A file is created at web-direct/package-assets/package-manifest.json in the ctrlX file structure.
Modify this file as you would for a ctrlX manifest and re-install the app. 
The manifest should update accordingly.
